I sure hope I'm right in giving up hybrid attribute/synapse based node relationships and going the synapse route. I grappled with this for a long time and never really came to any conclusion, I always thought the right answer would become apparent once I began to seriously code the system. Now that I'm doing this and have consulted with LLM, I'm taking the plunge.

"It's a girl, my lord, in a flatbed ford, slowin' down to take a look at me." It's about time to review Cursor's work on the node database front. Been vibing so long, building up my vision, and now I have tech debt of structural inspection to work off the old-fashioned way, the way they built [Apollo](https://github.com/chrislgarry/Apollo-11/blob/master/Luminary099/AOSTASK_AND_AOSJOB.agc#L119)

I'm really dedicated to full flexibility and robustitude for the nodes database on my first pass through. This means distilling a decade of mental factoring and refactoring into a performant and extensible core system. I need to have full confidence in the heart of my project. I need to have this the way I've always envisioned it. I feel unease and discomfort at having Cursor-generated code that I have not thoroughly inspected. I will feel great relief at having fine-tuned it. I do want to do this work, even though it flags my VISION and FEATURE production, because I want my engine purring like a kitten. I do not want to do this work, because this is where mind merges with machine, and I give over my hedonism to strict material logic and conformance to mathematical reality. It's a state of being that is terribly cold and quiet like being in space.

Look at me rambing when Cursor is ready for another prompt!
