Whitepine is hope, big hope, and as I watch it take form I feel power and voice forming, and I can work with those things. You've heard me on Discord. Yeah, yeah, I know, but there's a lot good about that. I mean it. Where is the love? We only got one world. That's all we got. We just watched Germany get infested with ugliness which bloomed into evil. That was only last century. We can't claim we haven't been taught to do better - we have, and I'm living proof of that. I don't know where these vain and avaricious clowns came from, but it makes sense, because my nation is dominant in terms of several forms of international power and naturally criminals will gravitate to that sort of reach. Rich criminals. So, this is a trial upon our very institution which is still active on this Earth, our very Republic, the officers of which solemnly swear:

...I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign...
...and *domestic*.

The people are looking for hope every day in their doomscroll - they do not find it.

If Whitepine is positioned in front of them in their search, will they swipe away? Or will they Google?

There are SO MANY OF US with tears on our faces.

The numbers of those people are big numbers.

Each of them, holding miniscule but true political power, each like a grain of sand, counted together, poured into a canvas sack, makes a bag heavy like lead that a grown man struggles to lift. A bag so heavy if it fell off a roof toward him he would dive to get out from under it.

Eventually, we'll want to move into the mediation space. Style it like a courtroom with a judge-judy vibe, employing a true honest-to-god bona-fide JURY of PEERS connected to each other via Whitepine UX and paid in Bitcoin for their civic service expertise. Arrangements can be made to call in different class of jurors from amateur up to professional or elite. Set up as a state-recognized certified mediation board, legally-binding settlements can be determined and made available at the tap of a screen for judicial review in a court of law with real, binding consequences.

Why not? The people could use a small claims court that actually works for them and doesn't cost an arm and a leg. The people would see more justice and feel their real power in the world. Why not? Tell me why not.

So put up a notice to entrepreneurs offering a contract for our proprietary mediation software for use in an online AI mediation startup out in silicon valley. A clever entrepreneur sees the potential and starts himself a for-profit venture; gratefully licensing our software from us, through which to perform turnkey AI mediation. They pay licensing fees back to us, funding our continued operation as a non-profit. Whitepine is FREE. Merry Christmas, Democracy.

I sure hope I'm right in giving up hybrid attribute/synapse based node relationships and going the synapse route. I grappled with this for a long time and never really came to any conclusion, I always thought the right answer would become apparent once I began to seriously code the system. Now that I'm doing this and have consulted with LLM, I'm taking the plunge.

"It's a girl, my lord, in a flatbed ford, slowin' down to take a look at me." It's about time to review Cursor's work on the node database front. Been vibing so long, building up my vision, and now I have tech debt of structural inspection to work off the old-fashioned way, the way they built [Apollo](https://github.com/chrislgarry/Apollo-11/blob/master/Luminary099/AOSTASK_AND_AOSJOB.agc#L119)

I'm really dedicated to full flexibility and robustitude for the nodes database on my first pass through. This means distilling a decade of mental factoring and refactoring into a performant and extensible core system. I need to have full confidence in the heart of my project. I need to have this the way I've always envisioned it. I feel unease and discomfort at having Cursor-generated code that I have not thoroughly inspected. I will feel great relief at having fine-tuned it. I do want to do this work, even though it flags my VISION and FEATURE production, because I want my engine purring like a kitten. I do not want to do this work, because this is where mind merges with machine, and I give over my hedonism to strict material logic and conformance to mathematical reality. It's a state of being that is terribly cold and quiet like being in space.

Look at me rambing when Cursor is ready for another prompt!
