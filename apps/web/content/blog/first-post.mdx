# Welcome to Our Blog

This is our first blog post using **MDX** with Next.js App Router! 

## What is MDX?

MDX is a powerful format that lets you write JSX in your markdown content. This means you can:

- Use React components directly in your markdown
- Create interactive content
- Maintain the simplicity of markdown while adding React's power

## Features

Here are some of the features we've enabled:

- **GitHub Flavored Markdown** support
- **Automatic heading links** with slugs
- **Custom styling** with Tailwind CSS
- **TypeScript support** for type safety

## Code Example

Here's a simple code example:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

## What's Next?

We'll be adding more content and features to our blog. Stay tuned for more updates!
