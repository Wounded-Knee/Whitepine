## Contingency & Acceleration Strategies

To ensure financial resilience and maximize operational velocity, we have identified multiple backup and acceleration mechanisms:

### Financial Risk Mitigation

- **Bridge Financing:** Several fiscal sponsors offer zero-interest advance funding against approved grants during disbursement waiting periods
- **Corporate Matching Programs:** Technology firms including Google.org and Salesforce.org provide 1:1 matching for verified nonprofit donations
- **Infrastructure Credits:** Active applications for AWS Activate for Nonprofits, MongoDB for Startups, and GitHub for Education programs to offset hosting and development costs
- **Volunteer Professional Network:** Recruitment of pro bono UX research, security audits, and legal counsel to reduce paid consulting expenses

### Acceleration Opportunities

- **Early Partnership Revenue:** Paid pilot programs with progressive municipal governments
- **Corporate Sponsorship:** Strategic partnerships with civic technology companies
- **Foundation Program Officers:** Direct cultivation relationships with program staff at target foundations
