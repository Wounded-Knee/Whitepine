### Declaration of
# Constitutional Civic Assembly

We declare who we are, plainly and proudly: We are United States citizens honor-bound to the Constitution, committed to free speech, assembly, and civic duty. We are patriots who accept the responsibility which is coupled to our freedom. We abide under the protections of the First Amendment, we honor the Constitution as our guide, and we use Whitepine as our civic platform for collective voice, verified fact, and accountable action.

We affirm these core commitments:

## Lawful exercise of rights

We assert our rights of speech, petition, and assembly under the Constitution, and we act within the law. When our rights are engaged, we do so openly, peacefully, and with respect for the safety and dignity of others.

## Nonviolence

Our public posture is nonviolent. We will not organize, plan, or carry out violence as long as our duly-appointed authorities are doing so in accordance with our laws.

## Transparency

We document actions, decisions, and communications on Whitepine, so the public record is clear. Transparency builds trust, and trust constrains abuse.

## Accountability

We welcome independent review, legal oversight, and public audit. Any member who violates our standards of conduct is subject to transparent discipline.

## Cooperation

We coordinate with lawful public institutions, emergency services, and community partners to support public safety, disaster response, and civic needs. We seek memoranda of understanding where appropriate, and we submit to lawful command structures in emergencies.

## Privacy

We protect personal privacy and we guard against doxxing, harassment, and unlawful surveillance. Whitepine will support secure channels for those who need anonymity for safety, while preserving verifiable evidence standards when required.

## Journalism

We train our members in fact checking, de-escalation, and lawful civic process. We use Whitepine to teach, to verify claims, and to organize constructive civic responses that strengthen democratic practice.

## Nonpartisan

In our official capacities we will not act as agents of any partisan campaign. We exist to serve the public good, to defend constitutional liberties, and to hold institutions accountable, regardless of party.

## Self-Defense

We acknowledge that the law protects individual rights that citizens may choose to exercise privately, according to applicable statutes and case law. Our public work does not obstruct or condemn private weapons use in the maintenance of a well-regulated militia, this being necessary for the security of a free state.

## Daylight

We pledge to operate publicly, to keep records, and to invite scrutiny. We will not hide our aims behind secrecy. We will earn the trust of our neighbors by what we do and by what we publish.
