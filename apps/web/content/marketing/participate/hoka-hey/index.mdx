# ⚡ You're invited to stand at the edge of history

Hey crew —

Something real is happening.

In **six months**, we're hosting the first **collective interview with the President of the United States** — a live event where **millions of citizens help guide the questions in real time** through our new civic platform, **Whitepine**.

We've built **clever, cutting-edge software** to make it possible — and before the world sees it, we're inviting a handful of early voices to preview it and stand at the front of the movement.

All we're asking right now is simple:

✅ **Sign the support pledge** — say *"Let's do it."*  
✅ **Share that you did.**

No newsletters.  
No donations.  
No spam.  
Just your name and your stand.

If you consent, we'll **honor you by name** as one of the first 100 — the **Tier Alpha Founders** — when this goes live before the nation.

This is history in motion.

You were invited because your voice carries truth and fire.

          <h2>The Full Story</h2>

          <p>Here's what we're <strong>really</strong> building:</p>

          <p>In six months, we're hosting a <strong>live, televised interview</strong> with the President of the United States — but not like anything you've seen before.</p>

          <p>This isn't a journalist asking questions.<br />
          This isn't a town hall with pre-screened participants.</p>

          <p><strong>This is the entire nation, speaking as one.</strong></p>

          <p>Through Whitepine's platform:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Millions of citizens</strong> can submit questions in real time</li>
            <li>Our <strong>AI-powered consensus engine</strong> surfaces the most important voices</li>
            <li>The <strong>questions that matter most</strong> rise to the top</li>
            <li>The President answers <strong>directly to the people</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <p>We're building the future of democratic dialogue.</p>

          <p>And we need <strong>100 founding voices</strong> to stand with us before we announce to the world.</p>

          <p>Will you be one of them?</p>
