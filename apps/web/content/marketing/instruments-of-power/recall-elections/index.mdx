Remove officials mid-term when they betray the public trust

## What is this?

A recall election allows voters to remove an elected official from office before their term ends. 
It's a direct form of accountability when an official has violated the public trust through corruption, 
incompetence, or betrayal of campaign promises.

Not all states allow recalls, and the specific rules vary widely. Where available, recalls provide a powerful 
tool to remove bad actors without waiting for the next election cycle.

### Where recalls are available

19 states allow recall elections for state officials, and many more allow recalls at the local level 
(mayors, city council, school boards, etc.). Check your state and local laws to see what's possible.

### States with recall provisions (for state officials)

## Alaska

## Arizona

## California

## Colorado

## Georgia

## Idaho

## Illinois

## Kansas

## Louisiana

## Michigan

## Minnesota

## Montana

## Nevada

## New Jersey

## North Dakota

## Oregon

## Rhode Island

## Washington

### Wisconsin

Note: Federal officials (President, Congress) cannot be recalled under current law. Many localities allow 
recalls even in states without state-level provisions.

How the recall process works

### 1. Review Legal Requirements

Each jurisdiction has specific rules: grounds for recall (some require specific causes, others allow 
any reason), signature thresholds (typically 15-40% of voters), and timing restrictions (some states 
prohibit recalls during the first or last portion of a term).

### 2. File Notice of Intent

Most jurisdictions require filing official paperwork before collecting signatures. This often includes 
a statement of reasons for the recall. The official may have an opportunity to respond.

### 3. Gather Signatures

Organize volunteers to collect petition signatures within the time limit (typically 60-180 days). 
Gather significantly more than required to account for invalid signatures. Follow all legal requirements 
for petition format and circulator registration.

4. Verification and Certification

Election officials verify that signatures are from registered voters in the jurisdiction. This process 
can take weeks. If enough valid signatures are certified, the recall election is scheduled.

5. Campaign and Vote

Run a full campaign for the recall election. Some jurisdictions have a simple yes/no vote; others 
simultaneously elect a replacement. Voters decide whether to remove the official and who should replace them.

### When recalls are appropriate

### ✓ Appropriate uses

- • Corruption or criminal conduct
- • Gross incompetence or negligence
- • Betrayal of clear campaign promises
- • Ethics violations
- • Abuse of power
- • Refusal to fulfill duties

### ✗ Inappropriate uses

- • Simple policy disagreements
- • Partisan revenge
- • Personal dislike
- • Single controversial but legal vote
- • Normal political debate
- • Issues better addressed at ballot box

Recalls are extraordinary measures that should be reserved for serious breaches of trust. Overuse 
can undermine democratic stability and create perpetual campaigning.

### Challenges in recall campaigns

### High signature thresholds

Many states require signatures from 25% or more of voters. This demands massive volunteer efforts 
and tight organization.

### Incumbent advantages

Officials facing recall still hold office and can use their platform, resources, and connections 
to fight back.

### Voter fatigue

Recall elections add to the already crowded election calendar. Motivating voters to participate 
can be challenging.

### Legal challenges

Officials often challenge recalls in court, questioning signature validity, petition format, or 
stated grounds. Be prepared for litigation.

Cost and time

Recall campaigns require significant resources and months of sustained effort with uncertain outcomes.

### Partisan polarization

Recalls can become proxy battles between parties rather than accountability mechanisms. Need clear, 
nonpartisan cause.

## Common questions

### Can we recall federal officials?

No. The U.S. Constitution does not provide for recall of federal officials. Congress members can only 
be removed by expulsion (vote of their own chamber), and the President only through impeachment.

### How often do recalls succeed?

Most recall attempts fail to gather enough signatures. Of those that make it to a vote, about 60% 
succeed at the local level, but success rates are lower for state officials.

### What if we don't have recall provisions?

Focus on other tools: primary challenges, general election opposition, petitions for resignation, 
public pressure campaigns, and advocacy for recall legislation.

### How do we prevent recall abuse?

High signature thresholds, time restrictions, and clear standards help prevent frivolous recalls. 
Reserve recalls for serious misconduct, not policy disputes.

### Know your recall rights

Research your state and local recall provisions. When officials betray the public trust, act.
