When enough of us stop buying, they have to listen

## What is this?

An Economic Veto is an organized boycott. We pool our buying power to send a message that can't be ignored.

You decide if you want to join. You make your own choices. We show the proof. We say what we want fixed.

### How it works: 3 simple steps

### 1. We Ask

First, we tell the company what they did wrong. We show them the proof. We tell them exactly what needs to change.

They get time to respond—usually 1 to 2 weeks. An independent group checks all the facts before we do anything.

### 2. We Act

If they don't fix it, we stop buying. We start small and build up if we need to.

First, light pressure. Then we focus on specific products. If that doesn't work, we go bigger—but only with a strong majority vote.

The system has time limits on everything. If things get too rough on workers or the economy, it automatically pauses.

### 3. We Finish

When the company agrees to fix the problem, we watch to make sure they actually do it. Progress is tracked where everyone can see it.

Then we announce "Return Week." Everyone goes back to shopping normally. Workers and suppliers get thanked. Everything gets saved as a record.

### What you do: Pick one

Open the app. Look at what's happening. Pick one button:

### Buy as usual

Use this during the "We Ask" step, or when we're done and it's Return Week.

### Don't buy

Use this during the "We Act" step. We count your choice (with your OK) but only as a total number. Nobody sees your personal info.

### How we stay safe

### Time limits

Everything has a time limit. We can't keep going forever. This stops things from getting out of hand.

### Emergency stops

If workers are getting hurt badly or the economy starts crashing, the system hits pause automatically.

### Outside checkers

An independent group checks the facts and decides if we can move forward. They don't work for us.

### No bullying

No threats. No attacking people personally. No harassment. Just free speech and personal choices.

### Your privacy

We collect as little as possible. We only show total numbers, never your name. Everything is tracked so nobody can cheat.

### Clear way out

We tell them exactly what fixes things. When they do it, Return Week starts and everything goes back to normal.

### How we measure results

We track how it's working with public numbers and independent checks. When the numbers show real change, 
we start wrapping things up and people go back to normal shopping.

## Common questions

### Is this legal?

Yes. Boycotts are protected under free speech when they're voluntary and peaceful. 
We help people organize and share information. You make your own buying choices.

### Will you buy or cancel stuff for me?

No. Never. We will never touch your money or make purchases on your behalf. You do everything yourself.

### What about workers and small suppliers?

## We have time limits, emergency stops, and a fund to help workers who get hurt.

Return Week brings everything back to normal once the problem is fixed.

### How does it end?

When the company fixes what we asked for and we can verify it, we announce Return Week. 
Everyone goes back to shopping normally. We save all the records.

### What info do you collect about me?

## As little as possible. Just enough to count how many people are participating.

We only share total numbers, never your personal information.

## Ready to join?

Add your voice. Follow the rules. Help make real change happen.
