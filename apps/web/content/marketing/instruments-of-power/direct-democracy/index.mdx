# Direct Democracy

Citizens don’t just elect leaders, they write laws.

Through **Initiatives,** people can propose new laws or constitutional changes and place them directly on the ballot. Through **Referenda**, they can approve or reject laws passed by the legislature.

These tools let citizens act when representatives won’t, and overturn bad laws when they must. True self-government means the people themselves hold the pen.

### What citizens have achieved

Citizen initiatives have enacted major policy changes that legislatures refused to pass:

### Minimum wage increases

Multiple states have raised minimum wages through ballot initiatives when legislatures wouldn't act.

### Cannabis legalization

Most legal cannabis states achieved it through citizen initiatives, not legislative action.

### Electoral reforms

Ranked-choice voting, redistricting reform, and campaign finance limits have passed through initiatives.

Tax and spending limits

Citizens have used initiatives to limit government spending, require voter approval for taxes, and more.

### Environmental protection

Clean energy mandates, pollution controls, and conservation measures passed via direct democracy.

### Civil rights

Marriage equality, anti-discrimination laws, and other civil rights protections have been both 
advanced and attacked through initiatives.

Challenges and concerns

### Money matters

Signature gathering and campaigns cost millions. Well-funded special interests can dominate the process, 
though grassroots campaigns do sometimes prevail.

### Complexity

Some issues are too complex for yes/no votes. Poorly drafted initiatives can have unintended consequences. 
Careful drafting and voter education are essential.

### Minority rights

Direct democracy can be used to restrict minority rights. Courts provide some protection, but vigilance 
is needed to prevent tyranny of the majority.

### Voter confusion

Ballots with many measures can overwhelm voters. Confusing language or deceptive campaigns can mislead. 
Clear communication and honest advocacy are crucial.

## Common questions

### Does my state allow initiatives?

24 states allow citizen-initiated measures. Many more allow them at the local level. Check your state's 
constitution and local charter.

### Can the legislature overturn our initiative?

Depends on the state. Some prohibit legislative repeal for a period of time; others allow it. 
Constitutional initiatives are harder to overturn than statutory ones.

### How much does it cost?

For statewide initiatives: $1-10 million or more for signature gathering and campaigns. Local measures 
cost less. Costs depend on paid vs. volunteer signature gathering and opposition funding.

### What if we don't have initiative rights?

Advocate for adopting them. Several states have added initiative rights through constitutional amendments. 
Meanwhile, focus on other tools: elections, petitions, and public pressure.

### Make law directly

When representatives won't act, take legislative power into your own hands.
