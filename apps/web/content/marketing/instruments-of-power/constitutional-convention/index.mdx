# Constitutional Convention

The power to reshape government doesn't belong only to Congress.

## The Original Convention

The Constitutional Convention was the 1787 meeting in Philadelphia that replaced the Articles of Confederation with the U.S. Constitution. Delegates debated representation, executive power, slavery, and checks and balances. The final document was signed on September 17, 1787, then sent to the states for ratification.

## We Can Do This Again

Article V of the Constitution permits two paths for proposing amendments:

1. **By Congress**: Two-thirds of both the House and Senate propose an amendment (used for all 27 existing amendments)
2. **By Convention**: Congress must call a convention if two-thirds of state legislatures (34 states) submit applications

No Article V convention has ever been held. The rules for organizing one are not specified in the Constitution, creating uncertainty about how it would function.

<ConstitutionalConventionCarousel attempts={conventionAttempts} />

## Why Convention Applications Matter

Even when convention attempts fall short, they demonstrate popular will and pressure Congress to act. The threat of a convention helped produce the Seventeenth Amendment for direct election of senators.

### Power Without Precedent

An Article V convention would be only the second constitutional convention in American history. No one knows exactly how it would work:

- Would delegates be bound to a specific topic, or could they propose any amendment?
- How would delegates be selected?
- What rules would govern debate and voting?
- Could the convention propose multiple amendments?

These unanswered questions make some cautious about calling a convention, while others see this uncertainty as evidence that the convention power remains a viable check on federal overreach.

### The Double-Edged Sword

Opponents worry about a "runaway convention" that might propose radical changes beyond its stated purpose. Supporters argue that any proposed amendments still require ratification by 38 states, providing ample safeguards.

## Common Questions

### Has a convention ever been close to happening?

Yes. The 1960s reapportionment effort reached 33 states, one short of the threshold. The 1980s balanced budget push reached 32 states. The current Convention of States effort has 19 states, more than halfway to 34.

### What happens if 34 states apply?

Congress must call a convention. However, the Constitution provides no guidance on format, delegate selection, or rules. Legal scholars debate whether Congress has discretion over these details or whether states control the process.

### Can states rescind their applications?

This is unsettled law. Many states have rescinded past applications, but no definitive legal ruling addresses whether rescissions are valid or how long applications remain active.

### Would a convention propose just one amendment?

Unknown. Some argue that state applications can limit the convention's scope to specific topics. Others contend that once convened, a convention has plenary power to propose any amendments it chooses, subject to state ratification.

### How would delegates be selected?

The Constitution is silent. Presumably each state would determine its own method, perhaps through legislative appointment, popular election, or gubernatorial selection. Equal state representation seems likely but isn't specified.

## The Path Forward

The Article V convention remains the ultimate instrument of popular sovereignty—a way for states and citizens to propose constitutional changes when Congress won't act.

It's never been used. But the threat of using it has mattered. And if 15 more states join the Convention of States effort, we'll discover whether this 235-year-old constitutional provision still works.
