Withhold labor to force accountability

## What is this?

A strike is the collective refusal to work until specific demands are met. It's one of the most 
powerful tools available to workers, disrupting operations and cutting profits until employers (or governments) 
negotiate in good faith.

While traditionally associated with labor disputes, strikes can also be used for political goals: protesting 
government policies, demanding social change, or resisting authoritarian actions. The general strike—where 
workers across industries walk out simultaneously—is the ultimate expression of popular power.

## Types of strikes

### Economic Strike

Workers strike to improve wages, benefits, or working conditions. This is the classic labor strike, 
protected by federal law when properly conducted. Employers cannot fire strikers but can hire permanent 
replacements.

### Unfair Labor Practice Strike

Workers strike to protest illegal employer actions (union busting, retaliation, refusing to bargain, etc.). 
Stronger protections than economic strikes: strikers cannot be permanently replaced and have stronger 
reinstatement rights.

### Wildcat Strike

Spontaneous strike without union authorization. Often in response to immediate dangerous conditions 
or provocations. Legally risky but can be effective when workers feel they have no other option.

### Sympathy Strike

Workers strike in support of other workers' strikes, even if their own employer has done nothing wrong. 
Shows solidarity across workplaces. Legal protections vary; often prohibited by collective bargaining 
agreements.

### General Strike

Mass strike across multiple industries and workplaces, often for political rather than economic demands. 
Can paralyze entire cities or regions. The ultimate show of popular power. Rare in the U.S. but common 
elsewhere.

### Partial/Rolling Strikes

Strategic strikes where only some workers walk out, or workers strike in shifts or at specific times. 
Maintains some operations while demonstrating power. Less costly to workers while still creating disruption.

Legal rights and restrictions

### National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)

Federal law protects private sector workers' right to strike for better working conditions or to protest 
unfair labor practices. Protection includes freedom from retaliation, though employers can hire replacements 
during economic strikes.

### Public sector limitations

Many states prohibit public employee strikes, especially for "essential" workers (police, firefighters, 
sometimes teachers). Penalties can include firing and even jail. Check state law carefully.

### No-strike clauses

Many union contracts include no-strike clauses prohibiting strikes during the contract term (except for 
unfair labor practices or safety issues). Violating these can void contract protections.

### Peaceful conduct required

Strikers must conduct themselves lawfully: no violence, no property destruction, no blocking access beyond 
legal picketing. Unlawful conduct can result in termination and criminal charges.

### At-will employment caveat

Non-union workers have weaker protections. While the NLRA technically protects "concerted activity," 
at-will employees can often be fired for striking, especially if not part of an organized union campaign.

### Organizing an effective strike

### 1. Build Solidarity First

Before striking, ensure overwhelming worker support. Poll your coworkers. Address concerns. Build trust. 
A weak strike where only some workers participate will fail and make future organizing harder.

### 2. Define Clear Demands

What exactly do you want? Be specific and realistic. Vague or impossible demands give employers excuse 
to refuse negotiation. Know your bottom line and your ideal outcome.

### 3. Prepare Financially

Workers won't get paid during a strike. Build a strike fund in advance. Arrange hardship assistance. 
The side that can hold out longer usually wins—make sure it's you.

### 4. Provide Legal Notice (If Required)

Some contracts or laws require advance notice before striking. Healthcare workers, for example, must 
usually give 10 days notice. Consult a labor lawyer to ensure you're protected.

### 5. Organize Picket Lines

Establish picket lines outside the workplace. This demonstrates unity, discourages strikebreakers, 
and communicates your message to the public. Follow all laws regarding picketing and access.

### 6. Build Public Support

Engage media, rally community support, explain your cause. Public pressure on the employer can be as 
important as the economic pressure of the strike itself.

### 7. Negotiate Resolution

The goal is to win your demands, not to strike forever. Be ready to negotiate when the employer is 
willing. Know when to compromise and when to hold firm. Get agreements in writing.

Understanding the risks

### Strikes are powerful but risky. Consider these factors:

### Loss of income

Workers don't get paid during strikes. The longer it lasts, the greater the financial hardship. 
Ensure workers can sustain the strike.

### Potential job loss

In economic strikes, employers can hire permanent replacements. Even protected strikers may find 
themselves without jobs when it's over.

### Employer retaliation

While illegal, employers may retaliate subtly: worse shifts, denied promotions, hostile environment. 
Document everything and be prepared to fight.

### Public backlash

If your strike causes significant disruption (transit, healthcare, schools), public opinion may turn 
against you. Strong communication is essential.

### Internal division

Strikes can divide workers between strikers and those who cross picket lines. Relationships may be 
permanently damaged.

### Business closure

In extreme cases, prolonged strikes can drive employers out of business, costing everyone their jobs. 
Assess whether the employer can actually afford your demands.

## Common questions

### Do I need a union to strike?

No, but unions provide organization, legal protection, strike funds, and experience. Non-union strikes 
are riskier but still protected under the NLRA for "concerted activity."

### Can I be fired for striking?

Depends. In protected strikes, you cannot be fired, but you can be permanently replaced during economic 
strikes. Unfair labor practice strikers have stronger protections. Illegal or violent conduct removes protections.

### What if I need the income?

Striking requires sacrifice. Unions typically provide strike pay (though less than regular wages). 
Build savings or a strike fund in advance. Consider partial strikes to reduce income loss.

### Are general strikes legal?

General strikes are legal but complicated. Individual workers can strike for their own workplace issues. 
Coordinated multi-workplace political strikes occupy legal gray area and face strong resistance.

### Stand together, withhold labor

When workers unite and refuse to work until demands are met, they exercise their greatest power.
