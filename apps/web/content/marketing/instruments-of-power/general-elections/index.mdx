Field and fund independent or third-party challengers when both major parties fail

## What is this?

When both major party candidates fail to represent the electorate, general elections offer the opportunity 
to field independent or third-party challengers who will actually serve the people.

While the two-party system creates structural barriers, coordinated grassroots support can break through—especially 
in local and state elections where organized communities can compete with party machines.

## Strategic approach

### 1. Identify Winnable Races

Start local: city council, school board, state legislature. These races require fewer resources and 
have lower barriers to entry. Build a track record before attempting federal offices.

### 2. Recruit Quality Candidates

Look for people with integrity, relevant experience, community ties, and genuine commitment to service. 
They don't need party machinery—they need authentic connection to constituents.

### 3. Build Coalition Support

Independent candidates succeed by building coalitions across party lines—people who are fed up with 
both parties and ready for something different. Focus on issues, not ideology.

### 4. Run Professional Campaigns

Third-party and independent campaigns must be even more professional than major party campaigns. 
Meet all legal requirements, raise funds transparently, communicate clearly, and organize effectively.

## Overcoming structural barriers

### Ballot access

Each state has different rules for getting on the ballot. Research requirements early: petition signatures, 
filing deadlines, and fees. Organize volunteers specifically for this task.

### Media coverage

Media often ignores third-party candidates. Compensate with strong social media presence, earned media 
through newsworthy events, and direct voter contact like door-knocking.

### Fundraising

Without party infrastructure, independent candidates must build grassroots fundraising networks. 
Focus on small-dollar donors, transparent accounting, and demonstrating fiscal responsibility.

### Voter psychology

Many voters fear "wasting" their vote. Counter this by demonstrating viability through polls, 
endorsements, and crowd sizes. Make voting for you feel like joining a movement.

### Debate access

Debate rules often exclude third parties. Push for inclusion, file complaints if rules are unfair, 
and host alternative forums to showcase your candidate.

### Electoral systems

First-past-the-post voting makes third parties difficult. Advocate for ranked-choice voting and 
other electoral reforms while running strategic campaigns where you can win.

## It can be done

Independent and third-party candidates have won at every level of government. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), 
Angus King (I-ME), and many mayors and city council members prove it's possible with the right 
strategy and grassroots support.

## Common questions

### Isn't this just splitting the vote?

Only if you assume voters "belong" to one party or another. When both parties fail, voters 
deserve a real choice. The goal is to win, not to play spoiler.

### Can independents really win?

Yes, especially in local and state races. Even when they don't win, strong showings force major 
parties to address issues they were ignoring.

### What about party resources?

Party resources come with party control. Independent candidates trade institutional support for freedom 
to truly represent their constituents without answering to party bosses.

### How do we fund these campaigns?

Grassroots fundraising from small donors, transparent crowdfunding, and coalition support from groups 
and individuals tired of the two-party system.

## Ready to break the duopoly?

Support independent candidates who will put people before parties.
