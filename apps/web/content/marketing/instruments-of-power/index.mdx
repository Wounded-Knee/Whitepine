# Instruments of Power

When representatives fail to serve the people, citizens have powerful tools to restore accountability. These are peaceful, lawful instruments of democratic power.

## [Constitutional Convention](/marketing/instruments-of-power/constitutional-convention)

Article V permits a convention to propose constitutional amendments if two-thirds of state legislatures apply. No Article V convention has ever been held, but several attempts came close.

## [Economic Veto](/marketing/instruments-of-power/economic-veto)

An organized boycott that pools buying power to send a message that can't be ignored. When enough of us stop buying, they have to listen.

## [Primaries](/marketing/instruments-of-power/primaries)

Challenge dishonest incumbents inside their own party. In safe districts, the real election is the primary—change the representative without waiting for the general election.

## [General Elections](/marketing/instruments-of-power/general-elections)

Field and fund independent or third-party challengers when both major parties fail to represent the electorate. Break the duopoly.

## [Recall Elections](/marketing/instruments-of-power/recall-elections)

Remove elected officials from office before their term ends when they betray the public trust. Available in 19 states for state officials, and many localities.

## [Direct Democracy](/marketing/instruments-of-power/direct-democracy)

Bypass unresponsive representatives entirely and legislate directly. Citizens can propose new laws or veto bad ones through direct democracy.

## [Petitions](/marketing/instruments-of-power/petitions)

Demand specific commitments or resignations through formal requests signed by multiple people. Protected by the First Amendment right to petition.

## [Demonstrations](/marketing/instruments-of-power/demonstrations)

Direct, lawful expression of organized disapproval through protests, marches, rallies, and vigils. Public displays of collective sentiment.

## [Strikes](/marketing/instruments-of-power/strikes)

Withhold labor to force accountability. The collective refusal to work until specific demands are met—one of the most powerful tools available to workers.
