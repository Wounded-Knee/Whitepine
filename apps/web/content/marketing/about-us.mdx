    # About Whitepine
</Hero>

We are citizens of the United States of America. We have watched the decades roll by with unease as the promise of our Republic was hollowed out, corrupted, and left to stumble on borrowed time. We called into the void—letters, petitions, marches, protests—and heard little more than echoes. Criminals roam freely inside our government. Information is hidden that by law should be ours. FOIA is a ghost, justice is blind in the worst way, and the people’s voice is scattered, unorganized, unheard.

    # Sigh.
</Hero>

For too long, we waited for someone to deliver us a digital democracy. The dream was out of reach in the 1980s, the 1990s, the 2000s, even the 2010s. But the technology is here now—*and has been for years*. And yet no one built it.

    # Digital democracy
</Hero>

Then came the realization: no one is coming. *We are the chosen ones.* We are the People who supplied government with the Constitution, not the other way around. It is only natural that we also supply government with a living, breathing hotline to the will of the people—open, always-on, incorruptible, undeniable.

    # Government is in our hands
</Hero>

Civic infrastructure is not someone else’s job. It’s ours. And we know what to do, because we learned history. So we did not wait—we began. The result is Whitepine.

    # Right Now
</Hero>

We took Pink’s advice to just TRY. We heard Eddie Van Halen’s voice: *Right Now.* We tuned our ears to the echoes of musket fire, Indian war cries, and colonial war crimes. And we answered with code.

    # Why now?
</Hero>

Why? Because we recognize the Republic’s inalienable right to designate its own representatives, however we see fit - even through the cloud. Because we see the Fourth Estate vanishing, and we know that without it, corruption festers... in darkness. Because we refuse to live in a sleazy caricature of liberty. Because we see how the Internet is ready to serve its own tour of patriotic duty.

    # Your needs, your solutions
</Hero>

We care deeply about the future of Liberty, Justice, and Truth in these United States. You, multiplied by millions of other citizens, are more powerful than any single individual will ever be.

This is not an idea to be taken lightly.

It's not an idea that can be ignored once you've marvelled at its potential. Depending on how our republic chooses to use this tool, massive change can be realized. Once mountains have been moved politically, nobody will ever take this app off their phone again.

So naturally, we had to try!

For the future.
