# Symbols of Democratic Unity

## The Roots of American Self-Governance

Every republic needs symbols — not for ornament, but for memory. They carry the weight of principles that must be passed from generation to generation. Symbols are the language democracy speaks to itself.

This collection explores the symbols that ground Whitepine's mission and connect our digital civic platform to the deepest roots of American self-governance.

## Featured Symbols

### [The Great Tree of Peace](/marketing/symbols/great-tree-of-peace)

The ancient Haudenosaunee symbol of unity, peace, and democratic confederation — the living ancestor of the American Constitution and the inspiration for Whitepine's name and mission.

### [The Thirteen Arrows](/marketing/symbols/thirteen-arrows)

From the Peacemaker's bundle to the eagle's talon on the Great Seal: the enduring symbol of strength through unity and the unbreakable bond among equals.

*More symbols will be added as we grow. Each one tells a story about who we are and what we protect.*
