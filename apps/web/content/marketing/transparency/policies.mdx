# Policies

## Our Policy Framework

These policies govern how we operate, protect user rights, and maintain ethical standards. We are committed to transparency, accessibility, and respect for all participants in our platform.

## Ethics Policy

### Code of Conduct

We maintain a respectful and inclusive environment for all participants. Harassment, discrimination, threats, or abusive behavior will not be tolerated. All community members are expected to engage in good faith and treat others with dignity.

**Core Principles:**
- Respect and dignity for all participants
- Transparency in all operations
- Accountability to the community
- Commitment to truth and evidence

### Conflict of Interest

Platform administrators and moderators must disclose any personal, financial, or organizational interests that could influence their decisions. We maintain clear separation between commercial interests and community governance.

### Ethical AI Use

When we use AI systems, we ensure they are deployed transparently with human oversight. Users will be informed when interacting with AI-generated content or automated decision-making systems. We prohibit AI uses that manipulate, deceive, or exploit users.

## Accessibility Policy

We are committed to ensuring our platform is accessible to all people, including those with disabilities. We strive to meet or exceed accessibility standards and continuously improve the user experience for everyone.

### WCAG Compliance

We are committed to meeting WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards. Our development process includes regular accessibility audits and testing with assistive technologies.

### Assistive Technology Support

- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation
- Alternative text for images
- Captions for multimedia content

### Language Access

We provide English language content as our primary language. We are committed to working with communities to provide translations and language access as our platform grows.

## Data Protection Policy

We take your privacy seriously and implement strong protections for your personal data. Our practices comply with applicable US privacy laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

### Privacy Principles

- **Data Minimization**: We collect only what's necessary to provide our services
- **User Control**: You own your data and control how it's used
- **Transparency**: Clear policies and practices with no hidden data collection
- **Security**: Industry-standard encryption and security measures

### CCPA Compliance

California residents have specific rights under the CCPA. We do not sell personal information. We provide all users, regardless of location, the same privacy rights afforded to California residents.

### Data Retention

We retain personal data only as long as necessary to provide services or as required by law. Account data is deleted within 90 days of account closure unless legal obligations require longer retention.

### User Rights

- Right to access your data
- Right to delete your data
- Right to data portability
- Right to opt-out of data sharing

## Open License Policy

We believe in transparency and open access to the greatest extent possible. Our licensing approach reflects our commitment to community ownership and collaborative development.

### Software License

Our platform software is released under the MIT License, allowing for broad use, modification, and distribution. Source code is available on GitHub.

## Moderation Policy

We maintain a safe and productive environment through fair and transparent moderation. Our moderation decisions are guided by our Code of Conduct and community standards.

### Community Guidelines

All participants must respect community guidelines prohibiting harassment, spam, hate speech, and illegal content. Violations may result in content removal, warnings, or account suspension. Repeat or severe violations may result in permanent bans.

### Reporting Violations

If you witness policy violations, please report them using our reporting system. All reports are reviewed by moderators within 48 hours. We protect the identity of reporters and do not tolerate retaliation against those who report violations in good faith.
