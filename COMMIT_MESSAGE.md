feat: Refactor BaseNode component and consolidate synapse handling

Major refactoring of the BaseNode component with component decomposition and architectural 
simplification. Consolidates synapse handling by removing dedicated synapse services and 
controllers, integrating synapse logic directly into the node service. Adds new UI components 
for better node relationship visualization.

Component Refactoring: BaseNode Decomposition

- Broke down monolithic BaseNode.tsx (744 lines → 230 lines, 69% reduction)
- Created focused, single-responsibility components for better maintainability
- Implemented clean separation of concerns across multiple files
- Added backup files for safety (BaseNode.original.tsx, BaseNode.refactored.tsx)

New Component Structure
- BaseNode.tsx (main component, refactored)
- schema/generateNodeSchema.ts (dynamic schema generation)
- schema/fieldTemplates.tsx (custom field templates)
- utils/renderNodeId.tsx (node ID rendering utility)
- hooks/useNodeEditing.ts (editing state management)
- hooks/useNodeRelationships.ts (relationship configuration)
- types/BaseNodeView.types.ts (TypeScript interfaces)
- SynapticRoleGroup.tsx (general purpose collapsible groups)
- GroupedRelativesView.tsx (role-based relatives grouping)

New Feature: Synaptic Role Grouping

GroupedRelativesView Component
- Groups relatives by synaptic role in collapsible containers
- Prominent role display with blue gradient headers
- Smart collapsible behavior: >3 nodes start collapsed, ≤3 start open
- Sub-grouping by node type within each role (e.g., "2 posts, 1 user")

Enhanced Visual Design
- Blue gradient headers for each synaptic role
- Role badges with clear visual distinction
- Collapsible containers with smooth animations
- Node count indicators and type breakdowns

API Architecture Simplification

Synapse Service Consolidation
- Removed dedicated SynapseService (372 lines deleted)
- Removed dedicated SynapseController (286 lines deleted)
- Removed dedicated synapse routes (/api/synapses endpoint)
- Integrated synapse logic directly into NodeService

Node Service Enhancements
- Added inline synapse creation methods to NodeService
- Consolidated synapse handling with node operations
- Simplified API surface - synapses are now handled as node operations
- Maintained backward compatibility for existing functionality

Route Cleanup
- Removed /api/synapses routes (81 lines deleted)
- Removed /api/isolated-posts routes (13 lines deleted)
- Updated main route index to reflect simplified structure
- Consolidated node-related endpoints

Bug Fixes and Improvements

MongoDB ObjectId Handling
- Enhanced ID normalization in nodeIdMiddleware.ts
- Improved ObjectId validation and error handling
- Fixed edge cases in ID processing pipeline

Frontend State Management
- Improved Redux state handling in nodesSlice.ts
- Enhanced error handling in useNodeRequest.ts
- Better loading state management across components

Type System Improvements
- Enhanced node ID utilities in @whitepine/types
- Added new type definitions for node ID handling
- Improved TypeScript compilation and type safety

Validation Updates
- Updated node validation schemas to reflect architectural changes
- Enhanced synapse validation within node creation
- Improved error messages and validation feedback

Benefits Achieved

Maintainability
- Single responsibility principle - each file has one clear purpose
- Easier debugging - issues isolated to specific components
- Reduced cognitive load - smaller, focused files
- Simplified API architecture - fewer services to maintain

Testability
- Individual component testing - each piece can be unit tested
- Mocked dependencies - hooks and utilities can be easily mocked
- Isolated functionality - schema generation, editing, relationships
- Reduced service complexity - fewer integration points

Reusability
- Schema generation can be used by other components
- CollapsibleGroup can be used throughout the application
- Utilities are available for any node-related functionality
- Consolidated synapse logic reduces code duplication

Performance
- Better tree-shaking - unused code can be eliminated
- Code splitting opportunities - components can be lazy-loaded
- Reduced bundle size - more efficient imports
- Simplified API calls - fewer service layers

Developer Experience
- Better IDE support - focused files with clear purposes
- Easier onboarding - new developers can understand specific pieces
- Parallel development - multiple developers can work on different aspects
- Simplified debugging - fewer moving parts in the system

Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to public APIs
- Original files backed up for reference
- Gradual migration path for future enhancements
