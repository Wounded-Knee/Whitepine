# Multi-Job Deployment Workflow

This document explains the new multi-job deployment structure that breaks down the monolithic deployment into logical, maintainable jobs.

## 🏗️ Job Structure

### 1. **Build and Package** (`build-and-package`)
- **Purpose**: Build applications and create deployment package
- **Runs on**: GitHub Actions runners
- **Outputs**: Deployment package artifact
- **Steps**:
  - Checkout code
  - Setup Node.js and pnpm
  - Install dependencies
  - Build API and web app
  - Package all files for deployment
  - Upload as GitHub artifact

### 2. **Upload to Server** (`upload-to-server`)
- **Purpose**: Transfer files to server
- **Runs on**: GitHub Actions runners
- **Dependencies**: `build-and-package`
- **Steps**:
  - Download deployment package
  - Setup SSH key
  - Upload files to server
  - Upload deployment script

### 3. **Deploy on Server** (`deploy-on-server`)
- **Purpose**: Execute deployment on server
- **Runs on**: GitHub Actions runners (SSH to server)
- **Dependencies**: `upload-to-server`
- **Steps**:
  - Setup SSH key
  - Execute deployment script on server
  - Handle environment variables
  - Run deployment logic

### 4. **Verify Deployment** (`verify-deployment`)
- **Purpose**: Verify deployment success
- **Runs on**: GitHub Actions runners (SSH to server)
- **Dependencies**: `deploy-on-server`
- **Steps**:
  - Check PM2 status
  - Ensure NGINX is running
  - Test web app endpoints
  - Test API endpoints
  - Provide detailed diagnostics

## 🔄 Benefits of Multi-Job Structure

### **✅ Maintainability**
- Each job has a single responsibility
- Easy to debug specific steps
- Clear separation of concerns

### **✅ Reliability**
- Jobs can be re-run independently
- Better error isolation
- Artifacts preserved between jobs

### **✅ Debugging**
- Clear job boundaries
- Detailed logs per job
- Easy to identify failure points

### **✅ Performance**
- Parallel execution where possible
- Artifact caching
- Faster feedback loops

## 📁 Files Created

### **Workflow Files**:
- `deploy-production-multi-job.yml` - Main multi-job workflow
- `deploy-script.sh` - External deployment script
- `README-multi-job.md` - This documentation

### **Key Differences from Monolithic Approach**:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each job handles one aspect of deployment
2. **External Script**: Deployment logic is in a separate, version-controlled script
3. **Artifact Management**: Files are packaged and transferred as artifacts
4. **Better Error Handling**: Each job can fail independently with clear diagnostics
5. **Easier Testing**: Individual jobs can be tested in isolation

## 🚀 Usage

To use the multi-job deployment:

1. **Enable the workflow**: The multi-job workflow will run on pushes to `main`
2. **Monitor progress**: Each job shows clear progress and can be debugged independently
3. **Handle failures**: If a job fails, you can re-run just that job
4. **Debug issues**: Each job provides specific debugging information

## 🔧 Migration from Monolithic

The original monolithic workflow (`deploy-production.yml`) can be kept as a backup, while the new multi-job workflow provides:

- **Better maintainability**
- **Clearer debugging**
- **Easier testing**
- **More reliable deployments**

## 📊 Job Dependencies

```
build-and-package
    ↓
upload-to-server
    ↓
deploy-on-server
    ↓
verify-deployment
```

Each job depends on the previous one completing successfully, ensuring a reliable deployment pipeline.
